Horloge is a [Pomodoro](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique)-style timer, aiming at improving your work productivity.

## Core Features

* Includes a simple single-session timer
* [not implemented] Breaks your work sessions down into smaller work-slots and break-slots of custom durations
* [not implemented] Uses native system notifications to let the user know when a session ends or start (with [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier))
* [not implemented] System notifications can be disabled. If so, all output is written to the terminal in which Horloge has been started.
* [not implemented] A time session can be pause or reinitialized at any time.
* [not implemented] The program can be run as a daemon (in the background) or as a command line application attached to the terminal.
